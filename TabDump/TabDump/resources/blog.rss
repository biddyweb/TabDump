He befriended her, asked her to perform sexual acts in front of her webcam, and then used said material to control her.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-27078194">37</a> &nbsp;Pakistan: One of the schools in the country's capital has decided to name their library after Osama Bin Laden, calling him both a "martyr" and a "hero". The local government is not happy about this, because it (obviously) sends the world the wrong message about Islam.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27081279">38</a> &nbsp;South Korea: Lee Joon-seok, age 69, was the captain of the ferry that sank.

Today, the number is closer to 13,000. Putting those figures another way: In the mid-1970s, three out of every 100,000 people in Britain were diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Today, it's 17 out of every 100,000 people. Cheap holidays to Southern Europe and tan bed abuse are being blamed.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27100284">41</a> &nbsp;USA: Kraft is recalling 96,000 pounds (43,545 kilograms) of hotdogs. They're not dangerous, they're simply mislabeled as "Classic Wieners" instead of "Cheese Dogs". Word of advice: Buy hotdogs from your local butcher. They're guaranteed to taste a million times better.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27027200">42</a> &nbsp;USA: SpaceX successfully launched two tons of supplies and food to the International Space Station on Friday.

Unfortunately, said feature only searches videos offered by Amazon. That will change "this summer" with Hulu Plus, Crackle, and Showtime adding support. Netflix, however, is still missing.</p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/AYCSkTDXKRc">03</a> &nbsp;Apple: Different car makers are implementing CarPlay in different ways. This two and a half minute video from The Verge shows several of those variations, including one that doesn't even use a touch screen.</p><p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/04/17/ipad-mini-with-retina-display-hits-the-apple-refurbished-store-for-the-first-time-starts-at-339/">04</a> &nbsp;Apple: They've finally started selling refurbished iPad mini Retina units. The 16 GB model is $339, which is $60 cheaper than a new device. A good friend of mine never buys new Apple equipment, only refurbished stock, and I've never heard him complain.</p><p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/17/dropbox-acquires-cloud-photos-startup-loom-service-to-be-shut-down-as-users-transferred-to-carousel/">05</a> &nbsp;Dropbox: They bought two companies yesterday. The first is Loom. They have seven employees and make a photo management app for iOS and Mac users. The second is Hackpad, which TechCrunch calls "a lightweight, document-collaboration web and mobile application." No financial figures were disclosed.</p><p><a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/04/introducing-a-new-optional-feature-called-nearby-friends/">06</a> &nbsp;Facebook: They launched a new feature for their Android and iOS apps that allows you to see if your friends are nearby. What's great about this news isn't the feature itself, but how it was presented. Facebook went out of their way to emphasize, repeatedly, that this is optional and fully opt-in.</p><p><a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2014/04/17/introducing-flickr-3-0-for-iphone-and-android/">07</a> &nbsp;Flickr: They've launched a completely redesigned app for Android and iOS.

When you order the dummy units, Google puts a $50 hold on your credit card, which is released once you return the glasses.</p><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-18/htc-said-to-hire-former-samsung-u-s-marketing-executive.html">09</a> &nbsp;HTC: According to Bloomberg, HTC has "hired the former head of marketing at Samsung Electronics' U.S. mobile phone business as an adviser to Chairman Cher Wang." His name is Paul Golden, and on his LinkedIn profile, he says he "created and launched the highly successful Galaxy brand for Samsung." Marketing is one of HTC's biggest weaknesses, so this is rather exciting.</p><p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/04/17/line-launches-creators-market-let-upload-sell-stickers-users/">10</a> &nbsp;LINE: My favorite chat app has launched a sticker store that enables people to sell their own stickers. The company will take a 50% cut, and while the store only works in Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand at the moment, there are plans to expand.</p><p><a href="http://news.xbox.com/2014/04/xbox-one-march-npd">11</a> &nbsp;Microsoft: Yesterday, Sony said they sold seven million PS4 consoles.

This isn't exactly a new concept. For example, Vodafone UK will gladly offer you a mobile phone contract that includes "free" access to Spotify Premium.</p><p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/2520-charger/">13</a> &nbsp;Nokia: If you bought a Nokia Lumia 2520 tablet, what's wrong with you? No, but seriously, the company is issuing a recall over the charger. The plastic cap covering the metal contacts can fall off, and if you touch a piece of metal that's plugged into the wall, you know what happens next. Note this impacts roughly 30,000 chargers, so is that how many of these tablets were sold in total?</p><p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/us-samsung-elec-globalfoundaries-idUSBREA3G1L620140417?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">14</a> &nbsp;Samsung: In an effort to compete with (and piss off) TSMC, they're going to license their newest chip making technology to GlobalFoundries. More importantly, Samsung says they expect to begin "mass production of foundry chips using 14 nanometer FinFET technology in the fourth quarter." Today's top of the line smartphone chips use 28 nanometer technology. Qualcomm recently announced 20 nanometer chips, but they're not shipping until 2015.</p><p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029119/most-innovative-companies/tencent-the-secretive-chinese-tech-giant-that-can-rival-facebook-a#!">15</a> &nbsp;Tencent: Fast Company has published what many people are calling the definitive article on Tencent, China's largest internet company.

The first, ads in the Twitter app that point to other apps. Some of you might have already seen them. And the second, a generic mobile ad network powered by last year's MoPub acquisition (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/twitter-said-to-acquire-mopub/">allegedly for $350 million</a>).</p><p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/us-usa-wireless-fcc-idUSBREA3G1VW20140417">18</a> &nbsp;USA: Yesterday, AT&amp;T threatened to not participate in the FCC's 2015 spectrum auction if there were rules in place limiting how much spectrum they could buy. Today, the Head of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, said he doesn't care.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27066024">19</a> &nbsp;Weibo: China's version of Twitter went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange yesterday. Their share price went up almost 20% by the end of the day.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>The Real World</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26925271">20</a> &nbsp;Belgium: The brains of 21 art students and 23 regular people were scanned and compared. Turns out artists have "significantly more grey matter in an area of the brain called the precuneus in the parietal lobe." Translation: Artists have better motor skills.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27056809">21</a> &nbsp;Brazil: Scientists have discovered insects with confusing genital characteristics. The women have "penises" called "gynosomes" that they stick into male "vaginas" which are said to hold sperm. But the most impressive discovery, to me at least, is that these insects have sex for 70 hours at a time.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-27076019">22</a> &nbsp;India: A Delhi surgeon has just reported that he has successfully removed 12 bars of gold, weighing almost 400 grams total, from a man's stomach. That's certainly one way to hide it.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27065532">23</a> &nbsp;Iran: They agreed to cut their supply of enriched uranium by half earlier this year, and they've complied, so the United States is unfreezing Iranian funds worth roughly $450 million.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27075632">24</a> &nbsp;South Korea: The latest numbers on the ferry disaster: 26 people dead. 179 people rescued. 270 still missing.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27054366">25</a> &nbsp;Space: Kepler 186f is being described by scientists as the "most Earth-like planet yet". It's roughly 10% larger than our planet, it's 500 light years away, it has an orbit of roughly 130 days, and it's believed to be a rocky planet that may hold water.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27063715">26</a> &nbsp;UK: The King's College of London has been tracking 7,771 children since 1958 to study the effects of bullying. Their data shows those who were frequently bullied at a young age never really recover from the harassment. They often face depression, anxiety, and even have suicidal thoughts. Bullied children also end up turning into less educated adults, and thus earn less.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27063796">27</a> &nbsp;UK: Where's the best place to put all the CO2 that your coal burning power planet spits out? Under the ground, of course. The White Rose carbon capture and storage (CCS) project will be awarded $415 million in June by the European Union. Once complete, said plant will be able to power 630,000 homes, and 90% of the CO2 it outputs (two million tons a year!) will be stored in undersea rock formations.</p><p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/04/battling-for-control-of-eastern-ukraine/100719/">28</a> &nbsp;Ukraine: The Atlantic has published 36 photos of the latest events in Ukraine.

Well, the President of the United States just said "I don't think, given past performance, that we can count" on Russia to uphold their end of the bargain.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27069715">31</a> &nbsp;USA: Alfa Romeo will start selling cars in the United States again this year, after leaving the market in mid-90s. Before you get all excited, here's the sad quote: "The company says it expects to sell just under a thousand regular 4C models, at a base price of $54,000, by the end of this year."</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27069611">32</a> &nbsp;USA: An unnamed man urinated in a water reservoir that serves the city of Portland, Oregon. What does Portland decide to do with said reservoir? Empty it.

What's the origin story of that number? In 1971, a bunch of guys from Northern California would always smoke weed together after school at roughly 04:20 PM every day.
